## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

- `filterTeacher INVOLVEMENT_FILTER_CATEGORY [t/] [TAG_FILTER CATEGORY]...`

Filters by involvement first, to filter by tag, add `t/`, followed by tag terms behind

The filter category is not case-sensitive e.g. “student” same as “STUDENT” but "t/" is not the same as "T/"

More than 1 filter is allowed e.g.  `INVOLVEMENT_FILTER_CATERGORY [t/] [TAG_FILTER CATERGORY] [TAG_FILTER CATERGORY]`.

Example: 
- `filterStudent class t/rep` - will return all students with the involvement containing “class” and tag containing 
  “rep”.
- `filterStudent class` - will return all students with the involvement containing “class”.
- `filterTeacher t/colleague admin` - will return all teachers with the tag containing “colleague” and "admin".


### Copying fields
For a filtered sublist of people, copy data based on a certain field to the clipboard. The fields that can be copied are:

- email
- handphone number
- name

Format: `copy f/FIELD`

Example: `copy f/email` - will copy all the email of the filtered sublist of people to the user's clipboard.

### Exiting the program : `exit`

Exits the program.

Format: `exit`

### Adding grades to students
Changes the grades or adds a new grade for the student.

`grades /s STUDENT NAME /u UPDATED GRADES`

The updated grades hould be in a dictionary form, seperated by commas.

Example: `grades /s John Smith /u Biology:A,Chemistry:B,Chinese:C`

Note that one can add an unlimited number of subjects.

If the subject grade is already present, the subject grade will be updated to reflect the new grade specified in the command. Otherwise, a new subject grade will be added.

In the example command above, assume John Smith has the following grades:
- English: D
- Biology: B
- Chinese: D

Then after executing the command, the grades will be updated to
- English: D
- Biology: A
- Chemistry: B
- Chinese: C


### Saving the data

NewAddressBook data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

### Editing the data file

NewAddressBook data are saved as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, NewAddressBook will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.
